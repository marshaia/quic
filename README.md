# QUIC

A Quiz Creation Tool to Support Programming Classes.

QUIC was developed as part of my Master's Thesis in Software Engineering at Universidade do Minho.
I was supervised by Professor Pedro Rangel Henriques and Sofia Santos.


## What is QUIC?
QUIC, short for Quiz Creation (Tool), is a web application for creating quizzes (with multiple question types) and sharing them online through live sessions.
Its main goal is to assist programming classes, so the feature that makes this tool stand out is precisely the possibillity of editing, compiling, and evaluating code.


## Phoenix
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Navigate to `/assets` and run `npm install`
  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
